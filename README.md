Personal Website (Production Build)

This repository contains the production-ready, obfuscated build of my personal website.

The original source code is maintained in a separate private repository.
This repo exists only for deployment and hosting purposes, and includes the compiled dist output generated during the build process.

Notes

Source code is intentionally obfuscated to protect implementation details.

This repository is not intended for development or contributions.

Any updates here reflect a new production build from the original codebase.

If you’re interested in the implementation, design decisions, or tech stack, feel free to reach out.
